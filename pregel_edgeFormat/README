What the code is doing?
edge list => adjacency lists, create vertex dst-IDs that are not in src of (src, dst)

You can directly call “make” to generate a program “run”
The system is a more update version of Pregel+ at YanLab@UAB

The input should be a file of edges, each line of the format "srcID dstID"

Note that if your graph is big, you need to use Pregel+'s "put" program rather than "hadoop fs -put".

For this and more on how to run a Pregel+ program, please check http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/pregelplus/console.html

Program “run“ takes two input arguments:
1. the path of the input data on HDFS
2. the path to output the labeled graph data on HDFS
